# Pokémon Fusion MUCK Scripts
What is Pokémon Fusion MUCK?
============================
Pokémon Fusion is a role-playing MUCK where your character leads a party of six "pokémon" and fights against other trainers, including other players. The only catch is that you can be a half-pokémon half-human "fusion", and participate in these fights yourselves! This MUCK is based on the popular Pokémon series.

What is a MUCK?
===============
MUCK (multi-user... CK) is one of the many derivatives of the telnet-based MUD (Multi-User Dungeon) system. Its a type of telnet server that allows users to connect to a character and role-play via text; have their characters pose, look, and do rudimentary actions. These servers includes a scripting language to further develop what a character do, including implementing a full role-playing game combat system with stats and experience points.

What is this Repository for?
============================
This MUCK has most of the core Pokémon game's combat mechanism coded into scripts written in MUF (Multi-User Forth). However, the game-play is deep and complicated, and grows every couple of years. To help keep the scripts up-to-date as well as keep them easily maintained, files important to the combat were put into this repository.
