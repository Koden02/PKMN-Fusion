(
When a combo is happening, the first pokemon does nothing.  Then the second goes right after and the combo happens, the move power is doubled and it has its effect.
Grass + Fire will come out as fire pledge.  It doesn't matter what order they come in.  Because that's the combo that causes 'sea of fire'
grass + water comes out as grass pledge
and water + fire comes out as water pledge

Fire + Grass creates sea of fire on opponents side of the field.  All pokemon over there take 1/8th max HP damage per turn, effect negated by rain"
fire + water creates rainbow on users side of the field.  Rainbow doubles chance of secondary effects from moves.  [same effect as serene grace, does not stack]
Grass + water creates creates swamp on opponents side of the field, all pokemon speed over there is halved
These effects all last 4 turns
Also, only one pokemon does the move, and it comes out as double powered.
